# olivia-python

This is a simple Python implementation of Olivia digital modulation, used by amateur radio operators for text communication over HF in very low SNR conditions. It was written as a part of my thesis at Universit√† di Bologna.

Behavior was determined by documents available on the web and the source code of the C reference implementation, and tested against a popular (fldigi).

More details are available on request. If you are interested I can send you the full text of my thesis, but please note that it's written in Italian.
